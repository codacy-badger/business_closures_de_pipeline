# Intro
Hello, everyone! welcome to the walkthrough guide for the business_closures_de_pipeline. While building this pipeline I realised that there really isn't any good projects (That I have come across) which utilize Amazon DocumentDB as the main database. Thus, I decided to write a tutorial/walkthrough guide for my project so that others can replicate what I have done and hopefully gain some knowledge and experience which they did not have before going through this guide!

Before we begin, the building of this pipeline will be done in numerous stages so after you complete a stage feel free to take a break and come back to it later. This guide is on the long side becuase I wanted to be as detailed as possible to help lower the chance that you run into any issues along the journey. Now, without furtherado lets dive in and get started with our DocumentDB data pipeline!

# Architecture
This is the layout of the architecture we will be building:

I know it looks a little intimidating, but rest asured it really is not that bad once we get going.
